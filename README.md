# HS-NumericalSemiGroup

A Haskell project for computing the density of prime numbers within the gaps of a numerical semigroup.

## 📜 What This Program Does

This program computes the density of prime numbers relative to the set of "gaps" in a numerical semigroup generated by two integers, `a` and `b`.

### Mathematical Explanation

1.  **Inputs:** We start with two positive, coprime integers, **`a`** and **`b`** (meaning $\gcd(a, b) = 1$).

2.  **Numerical Semigroup (S):** We define a numerical semigroup $S$ as the set of all numbers that can be formed by a non-negative integer combination of `a` and `b`.
    * Let $\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, ...\}$ be the set of non-negative integers.
    * The semigroup is $S = \{ax + by \mid x, y \in \mathbb{N}\}$.
    * This set $S$ contains 0 and is closed under addition.

3.  **The Gaps (G):** The set of "gaps" $G$ is the set of all non-negative integers that are **not** in the semigroup $S$.
    * $G = \mathbb{N} \setminus S$
    * Because $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, this set of gaps $G$ is **finite**. The largest gap is known as the **Frobenius number**, $g(a,b) = ab - a - b$.

4.  **Goal (Prime Density):** This program identifies all the prime numbers that belong to the finite set of gaps $G$. It then computes the density of these primes relative to the total number of gaps.
    * Let $P$ be the set of all prime numbers.
    * The program analyzes the set $P \cap G$ (the primes that are also gaps).
    * The density is calculated as: $\frac{|P \cap G|}{|G|}$ (the count of primes in $G$ divided by the total count of gaps).

### Example

Let **`a = 3`** and **`b = 5`**:

* **Semigroup (S):** $S = \{3x + 5y \mid x, y \ge 0\}$
    * $S = \{0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ...\}$
    * (e.g., $8 = 3 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 1$, $9 = 3 \cdot 3$, $10 = 5 \cdot 2$)
    * All numbers greater than the Frobenius number $g(3,5) = 3 \times 5 - 3 - 5 = 7$ are in $S$.

* **Gaps (G):** The numbers *not* in $S$.
    * $G = \mathbb{N} \setminus S = \{1, 2, 4, 7\}$

* **Primes in G:** We check which numbers in $G$ are prime.
    * Primes $P = \{2, 3, 5, 7, ...\}$
    * $P \cap G = \{2, 7\}$

* **Density:** The program would compute the following:
    * Total number of gaps: $|G| = 4$
    * Total number of primes in gaps: $|P \cap G| = 2$
    * **Resulting Density: 2 / 4 = 0.5**

## 🔧 Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you must have **Docker** installed and running on your system.

---

## 🚀 Usage

This project is run using Docker.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

From your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command to build the image:

```bash
docker build -t nsgroup .
```

### 2. Run the Container

After the build is complete, run the container interactively:

```bash
docker run --rm -it nsgroup
```


### 3. Provide Input

The program will prompt you to enter two values, `a` and `b`, in order.

**Input Rules:**

- For a meaningful result, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` should be 1.
